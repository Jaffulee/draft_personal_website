## How to use this template in practice

1. **Fork or clone this repository**
2. Enable **GitHub Pages** (Settings → Pages → Deploy from branch)
3. Edit `index.html` and `styles.css` to suit your details

### Fast way to fill it out (recommended)

A quick way to customise the site is to:
- Paste your CV, bio, or LinkedIn profile into an AI tool (e.g. ChatGPT)
- Ask it to:
  - Rewrite your experience for a personal website
  - Populate each section of the template
  - Keep the tone concise and professional

You can then copy the generated text directly into the HTML sections.

This approach is especially useful if you:
- Don’t enjoy writing about yourself
- Want a fast first draft
- Plan to refine wording later

---

## Customisation tips

- Change colours and spacing using the CSS variables at the top of `styles.css`
- Add or remove sections by copying existing `<section>` blocks
- Replace the avatar image or rely on the initials fallback
- Keep content short — the layout is designed for scannability
